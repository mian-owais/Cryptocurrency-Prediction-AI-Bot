# AI Cryptocurrency Trading Bot Dashboard

This repository is a starter scaffold for an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading bot dashboard built with a Python backend and a Streamlit frontend.

## Project goals

- Collect crypto market data (via CoinGecko)
- Compute technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA, etc.)
- Train machine learning models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LSTM) to forecast price movement
- Convert predictions into actionable trade signals (BUY / SELL / HOLD)
- Provide explainability using SHAP
- Present everything in a Streamlit dashboard (live price, predictions, signals, SHAP visualizations)

## Architecture

## Quickstart

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate   # On Windows (bash.exe)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run src/app/streamlit_app.py
```

## File responsibilities

- `src/data_pipeline.py`: Fetch and preprocess data, compute indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA).
- `src/model_train.py`: Train models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LSTM) and persist the best model.
- `src/model_predict.py`: Load saved model and make next-interval predictions.
- `src/strategy_engine.py`: Convert model outputs to BUY/SELL/HOLD and provide portfolio optimization hooks.
- `src/explainability.py`: Compute SHAP values and prepare visualizations.
- `src/app/streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit app integrating live data, predictions, signals, and SHAP plots.

## Next steps / Optional features

- Add database storage (SQLite) for historical data and executed trades.
- Implement a Reinforcement Learning agent (Q-learning or DQN) for trade execution.
- Add Telegram/email alerts for signals and executed orders.
- Add automated unit tests and CI pipeline.

If you'd like, I can now implement the data fetching and indicator computation functions, wire a minimal training pipeline, or wire up the Streamlit UI with mock data. Tell me which area you want next.
